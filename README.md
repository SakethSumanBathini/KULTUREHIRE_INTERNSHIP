# Internship at KultureHire: Understanding Career Aspirations of Gen Z

This repository showcases my internship experience at KultureHire, where I conducted in-depth analysis on the career aspirations of Generation Z. The project involved data collection, cleaning, analysis, and dashboard development to better understand the challenges Gen Z faces in the workplace. Below are detailed explanations of each task I completed.

## 1. Understanding the Problem Statement Using 5W1H Framework
The first task was to clearly define and break down the problem statement regarding Gen Z's career aspirations using the **5W1H framework** (What, Why, Where, When, Who, and How). The problem revolves around the fact that Gen Z often struggles to pursue their desired roles, with their aspirations and preferences frequently being misunderstood or overlooked by employers. 

### My responsibilities:
- **Research and Analysis:** I conducted research on the current challenges faced by Gen Z in the workplace. 
- **Document Creation:** I wrote a comprehensive Word document that outlines the problem statement in detail, incorporating all aspects of the 5W1H framework to ensure a thorough understanding.
- **Objective Definition:** I defined the objectives and expected outcomes of the project, setting the stage for the subsequent data collection and analysis tasks.

## 2. Data Collection and Survey
Data collection was a critical step in understanding Gen Z's career aspirations. To achieve this, I created a survey using **Google Forms** with **25 well-thought-out questions** designed to gather insights on various aspects of career aspirations.

### My responsibilities:
- **Questionnaire Design:** I framed questions to gather diverse information, such as preferred industries, work environments, salary expectations, learning opportunities, and company values.
- **User-Centric Approach:** Ensured the survey was simple, user-friendly, and straightforward, with clear instructions for the respondents.
- **Test and Adjust:** I tested the form with a small sample group to identify potential gaps and fine-tune the questions for clarity and effectiveness before launching it to a wider audience.

## 3. Data Cleaning and Standardization
Once the survey responses were collected, my task was to **clean and standardize the dataset** to prepare it for analysis. The raw data had various inconsistencies, missing values, and multiple entries in a single cell, which needed to be addressed.

### My responsibilities:
- **Null Value Handling:** I filled in null cells using imputation techniques, either by using statistical methods or contextual judgment based on similar data points.
- **Data Formatting:** Reformatted the data to ensure consistency across the dataset. For instance, I standardized all text inputs (capitalization, spelling, etc.).
- **Splitting Data:** In cases where multiple data points were stored in one cell, I split them into separate rows or columns, making the data structured and easier to analyze.
- **Data Validation:** Conducted validation checks to ensure that no errors or inconsistencies were present in the final dataset.

## 4. Creating Pivot Tables for Business Questions
After cleaning the data, I was assigned the task of answering **19 business questions** related to the career aspirations of Gen Z using **pivot tables** in Excel. The questions were designed to uncover insights about Gen Z's expectations from their careers, focusing particularly on respondents from **India**.

### My responsibilities:
- **Pivot Table Creation:** Created multiple pivot tables, one for each business question, to summarize and analyze the data efficiently.
- **Filters and Segmentation:** Applied relevant filters (such as the country filter set to **India**) to narrow down the analysis and ensure that the insights were specific and actionable.
- **Data Insights:** Analyzed the output of the pivot tables to generate insights about Gen Z’s preferences in terms of job roles, learning opportunities, and work environments.
- **Documentation:** Documented the process and findings to help stakeholders understand the results.

## 5. Writing SQL Queries for Business Questions
Parallel to the pivot table analysis, I also wrote **SQL queries** to extract the necessary insights from the dataset for the same **19 business questions**. This helped in performing structured and efficient data analysis on the dataset.

### My responsibilities:
- **SQL Query Writing:** Drafted SQL queries to retrieve specific insights from the dataset, ensuring the correct use of aggregate functions, joins, and filtering conditions.
- **Optimization:** Optimized queries for performance, particularly when handling large datasets, ensuring that the data retrieval was fast and efficient.
- **Testing and Validation:** Ran the queries on the dataset and validated the results to ensure accuracy and consistency with the pivot table analysis.

## 6. Executive Dashboard
The next task involved creating an **interactive executive dashboard** that presents the insights from the analysis in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner. This dashboard was designed to cater to non-technical stakeholders, allowing them to easily interact with and understand the data.

### My responsibilities:
- **Chart Selection:** Carefully chose appropriate charts for each business question (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, line charts), ensuring that the data was represented clearly.
- **Color Schemes:** Applied a combination of gradient and solid colors to make the dashboard aesthetically pleasing while also adhering to best practices in data visualization.
- **Interactive Slicers:** Added slicers to allow users to interact with the dashboard by filtering the data on specific variables (e.g., gender, country, job role).
- **Final Presentation:** Delivered a polished, professional dashboard that conveyed the necessary insights while remaining easy to navigate and interpret.

## 7. Functional Dashboards
In addition to the executive dashboard, I created three **functional dashboards**, each focusing on a different aspect of Gen Z’s career aspirations. For these dashboards, I developed my own business questions, analyzed the data, and presented the findings using interactive dashboards.

### a. Learning Aspirations Dashboard
- **Business Questions:** I formulated questions around **learning aspirations**, such as the preferred methods of learning, opportunities for growth, and access to skill development.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted a thorough analysis of the data to answer these questions, focusing on trends and key insights that could inform employers about Gen Z’s learning expectations.
- **Dashboard Design:** Designed an interactive dashboard that included slicers and KPIs to allow users to filter data based on their interest and track key performance indicators related to learning aspirations.

### b. Manager Aspirations Dashboard
- **Business Questions:** This dashboard addressed questions related to Gen Z’s **managerial expectations**, such as preferences in management styles, concerns about working under an abusive manager, and desired qualities in a leader.
- **Data Analysis:** I analyzed the data to identify common patterns and trends regarding how Gen Z perceives managers and what they value in leadership.
- **Interactive Design:** The dashboard was designed with interactive elements like slicers and KPIs to make the data accessible and actionable for users.

### c. Mission Aspirations Dashboard
- **Business Questions:** I developed questions to understand Gen Z’s **mission aspirations**, such as how important it is for them to work for a company with a clear mission, values, and social impact.
- **Data Analysis:** The analysis focused on the alignment between Gen Z’s personal mission and that of potential employers, uncovering insights about the importance of company culture and mission-driven work.
- **Dashboard Design:** As with the other dashboards, I utilized slicers, KPIs, and various chart types to present the data in a way that was engaging and easy to understand.
